Note 1 : 
you are allowed to use your laptop Ubuntu to do your test cases!

Note 2 : 
if there are any *.txt input files unzipped from your Test Case, DO NOT open them in host OS (e.g. Windows)! Simply transfer them into Ubuntu, and use your program to read its data

(opening the *.txt input files in non-Ubuntu OS may cause the file's newline char to be saved by the editor in host-OS compatible format, rendering it un-readable in Ubuntu!)
